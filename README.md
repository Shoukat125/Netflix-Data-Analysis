# 🎬 Netflix End-to-End Data Analysis & Visualization

In this project, I have performed a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of the Netflix dataset. The primary objective was to understand how Netflix's content strategy has evolved over time and to analyze the impact of their "Glocal" (Global + Local) approach.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Interactive Web App:** Developed a live web application using Streamlit, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.
* **Strategic Dashboard:** Designed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize content distribution and ratings effectively.
* **Deep Insights:** Conducted detailed research on missing values, genre complexity, and duration comparisons between Movies and TV Shows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

* **Language:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Visualization:** Tableau Desktop
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled null values and pre-processed the dataset for accurate analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified content trends and shifts in the global market.
3. **Visualization:** Transformed complex data into simplified, intuitive charts and dashboards.
4. **Deployment:** Successfully deployed the analysis and interactive features on Streamlit.
